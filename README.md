This repository contains folders with custom levels for the Cooperation Hospital theme and our original Escape Room theme mod.
It also contains information on our meetings and sprints

## Escape Room
The primary gameplay mechanic the group aims to implement involves players working together to escape a room rather than healing patients with pills or syringes. This mechanic will require players to complete objectives such as finding keys to unlock doors or pressing buttons in a specific order with the help of clues.

## How to play
To play this mod, download modpack one. Put it in the filepath StreamingAssets/playerpackages/ and then run in the Co Operation game. Play with 2-4 players in person or online!
