# Co Operation: Escape Room mod
This repository includes two Escape-room level packages (WIP). Initially created as a 2nd-year group project at Plymouth University.

## Escape Room
The primary gameplay mechanic the group aims to implement involves players working together to escape a room. This mechanic will require players to complete objectives such as finding keys to unlock doors or pressing pressure plates.

## How to play
To play this mod, download modpack one. Put it in the filepath StreamingAssets/playerpackages/ and then run in the Co Operation game. Play with 2-4 players in person or online!
